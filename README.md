Practice works for BMSTU Big Data PL course

# Lab 1

All tasks of laboratory work 1 are launched from 1 executable of `lab1/src/main/scala/main.scala`.
Solutions to tasks of one variant are combined in one directory named `var*`.
Solution to each individual task of a variant is completed in a single file `task*.scala`.

To run an executable in your terminal:
```Shell
java -jar exec/lab1.jar [cmd line arguments]
```

Use `[cmd line arguments]` for partial run and Var1.Question5 functionality check (sum and mul of Integers). 

Partial run allows to launch only selected tasks. Pass `-p TASKS` at the beginning of arguments. 
TASKS is a string of digits from 1 to 4 without spaces. Order of digits controls order of tasks to be launched. It is possible to run a task several times.
 
`--help` prints a simple help message with definitions of cmd line arguments. 

# Lab 2

All tasks of laboratory work 2 are launched from 1 executable of `lab2/src/main/scala/main.scala`.
Solutions to tasks of one variant are combined in one directory named `var*`.
Solution to each individual task of a variant is completed in a single file `task*.scala`.

To run an executable in your terminal:
```Shell
java -jar exec/lab2.jar [cmd line arguments]
```

# Lab 4

All tasks of laboratory work 4 are launched from 1 executable of `lab4/src/main/scala/main.scala`.
Solutions to tasks of one variant are combined in one directory named `var*`.
Solution to each individual task of a variant is completed in a single file `task*.scala`.

# Lab 5

All tasks of laboratory work 5 are launched from 1 executable of `lab5/src/main/scala/main.scala`.
Solutions to tasks of one variant are combined in one directory named `var*`.
Solution to each individual task of a variant is completed in a single file `task*.scala`.

To run an executable in your terminal:
```Shell
java -jar exec/lab5.jar [cmd line arguments]
```

Use `[cmd line arguments]` for partial run and specifying input/output files. 

Partial run allows to launch only selected tasks. Pass `-p TASKS` at the beginning of arguments. 
TASKS is a string of digits from 1 to 8 without spaces. Order of digits controls order of tasks to be launched. It is possible to run a task several times.

`-io PATH` Path to a file with paths to input and output files (overrides -i and -o).
`-i PATH` Path to an input file (DEFAULT=input). 
`-o PATH` Path to an output file (DEFAULT=output)
 
`--help` prints a simple help message with definitions of cmd line arguments.
