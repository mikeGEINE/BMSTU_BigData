Practice works for BMSTU Big Data PL course

# Lab 1

All tasks of laboratory work 1 are launched from 1 executable of `lab1/src/main/scala/main.scala`.
Solutions to tasks of one variant are combined in one directory named `lab*`.
Solution to each individual task of a variant is completed in a single file `task*.scala`.

To run an executable in your terminal:
```Shell
java -jar exec/lab1.jar [cmd line arguments]
```

Use `[cmd line arguments]` for partial run and Var1.Question5 functionality check (sum and mul of Integers). 

Partial run allows to launch only selected tasks. Pass `-p TASKS` at the beginning of arguments. 
TASKS is a string of digits from 1 to 4 without spaces. Order of digits controls order of tasks to be launched. It is possible to run a task several times.
 
`--help` prints a simple help message with definitions of cmd line arguments.
